### **_[Humanitarian Projects](https://opensource.com/tags/humanitarian)_**  
This humanitarian project, _[Half of the worldâ€™s languages are dying. Should we save them?](https://opensource.com/article/17/7/half-world-languages-dying-save-them)_, interest me. The project's goal is to save languages as "there are currently around 7,000 languages being used today, with one language dying every two weeks." I found this project to be interesting because I also think this is very important and can personally relate to it. Although I was born in the U.S., I grew up in India for a few years and had the privilege to learn how to speak in my native language, Malayalam. Even though I do not have any trouble communicating, I unfortunately do not know how to read or write in my native language. There are many families that came from the same state as my family and their children were born and raised in the U.S. However, their children are mostly exposed to English (in schools, etc.). The only time they ever come in contact with Malayalam is with their parents at home or at some event where all Indian families gather (which does not happen very often). Hence, their children cannot speak, read or write Malayalam at all. Some can understand Malayalam but they only respond back in English. Others do not understand and so, their parents speak to them in English. As a result, they lose that part of their culture and cannot communicate with their own relatives that do not know English. As you can see, our native language is slowly disappearing from the Indian community here in the U.S. I'm assuming that the future generations (if they grown up here) will completely lose touch with Malayalam. Now, Malayalam is not a dying or an endangered language in the world (he provides a list of endangered languages in India: [197 languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_endangered_languages_in_India)), but the reason I shared this is because I thought it is similar to one of the ways languages can be lost overtime. Nonetheless, I really think the goal of this project is very valuable and important.    

### **_Project Progress_**  
On Nov 26: I created another [issue](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/30-seconds-of-cpp/issues/452) to work on implementing the reverse_copy method for algorithm.   
On Nov 28: The maintainer assigned me [this issue](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/30-seconds-of-cpp/issues?q=assignee%3Arajsukanya+is%3Aopen).    
The maintainer also [merged my first pull request](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/30-seconds-of-cpp/pull/446) and thanked me for my contribution!    
On Dec 3: I created a [pull request](https://github.com/Bhupesh-V/30-seconds-of-cpp/pull/457) after implementing the reverse_copy method.
