### **_Reflection_**  
In my second blog post, I wrote about making documentation contributions as my first contribution and I still standby that decision. I think it is a simple way to get started. But I also think that the second project that I worked on is a project that I can easily make contributions to. I was initially afraid to make coding contributions; however, working on this project erased all of my worries. Not only was it easy to contribute, but I also learned about methods I was not familiar with before. It was definitely a good experience! 

This class has definitely met my expectations and went beyond. Initially, I thought we were going to make coding contributions. But we also learned about linux and git, which I am so grateful for because it is very important. I initially took this class to learn more about open source, but I have acquired much more. I am very glad I took this course. Thank you professor! 

### **_Week 14 Summary_**     
This week I made one more blog edit. I fixed some spelling and grammar mistakes on my classmate's blog.
