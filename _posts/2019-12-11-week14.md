<!--
This is the last blog post that you will write for this class. This is a chance to reflect on what you did.
Go back to your first two blog posts. They asked you to write about
why you decided to take a course in open source software.
what types of contributions you thought would be suitable choices for you to make as your first contributions
to an open source project, and
what types of projects interest you and how you saw your relationship to them.
Did the course meet your expectations? What was different than you expected? 
How would you change what you wrote with respect to the last two questions (from Blog Post 2?)

BLOG #1:
Why did you decide to take a course in open source software?
I chose to take a course in open source software mainly because I needed an elective. Although I have limited knowledge of open source, I have heard people talk about OSS and some of its advantages in the past. To be honest, I was very curious and wanted to learn more. Initially, I did not know that Hunter College offered this course and when I found it, I thought this would be a great opportunity for me to learn and expand my knowledge about OSS.
BLOG #2:
What types of contributions do you think are suitable choices for you to make as your first contributions to an open source project? What types of projects interest you and how do you see your relationship to them?
Some suitable choices for my first contributions are to:
    Correct spelling and grammar mistakes in documentation
    Help write good documentation
    Build a glossary of technical terms
    Submit bug reports
I think it is fairly simple to fix any spelling and grammatical errors in documentations. It doesn't take much effort and is helpful at the same time. Also, writing good documentation is an important skill to have and I have only written documentation for small projects given in classes. By doing this, I can practice this skill as well as see how good documentation looks like for bigger projects. Creating a glossary of technical terms can be useful to anyone, especially beginners. I remember constantly looking things up when I first started (and even now) so, it would be convenient to have a glossary that one can refer back at all times. Lastly, encountering a bug can sometimes be messy and takes a lot of time in trying to find the exact bug. This can be extremely helpful to the programmer and, identifying the correct bug is another great skill to acquire.
As for projects, I am open to any ideas. I don't have any particular interests at the moment. But as I explore, I hope to find something that catches my interest.
